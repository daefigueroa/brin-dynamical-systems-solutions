\begin{stm}{stm:insert24a}[exercise]
Show that every edge shift is an SFT.
\end{stm}

\begin{stm}{stm:2}[proof]
If $\Sigma_B^e$ is an edge shift with graph $\Gamma_B$, then $\Sigma_B^e$ is precisely the set of sequences that do not contain the words $e'e$ of length $2$ in which the target of $e$ is not equal to the source of $e'$.
\end{stm}

\begin{stm}{stm:3}[proof]
Since this collection of words is finite, $\Sigma_B^e$ is an SFT.
\end{stm}
