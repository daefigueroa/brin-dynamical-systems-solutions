\subsection*{Exercise 3.2.3.}

\begin{exercise}{stm:ex3.2.3-insert24a}
Show that every edge shift is an SFT.
\end{exercise}

\subsection*{Proof {\color{blue}+ reasoning}:}

\begin{statement}{stm:ex3.2.3-2}
If $\Sigma_B^e$ is an edge shift with graph $\Gamma_B$, then $\Sigma_B^e$ is precisely the set of sequences that do not contain the words $e'e$ of length $2$ in which the target of $e$ is not equal to the source of $e'$.
\end{statement}

\begin{statement}{stm:ex3.2.3-3}
Since this collection of words is finite, $\Sigma_B^e$ is an SFT.
\end{statement}
