\subsection*{Exercise 1.4.3.}

\begin{exercise}{setup}
Verify that the metrics on $\Sigma_m$ and $\Sigma_m^+$ generate the product topology
\end{exercise}

\subsection*{Proof {\color{blue} + reasoning}:}

\begin{explanation}{stm:ex1.4.3-q2}
Firstly, what product topology is being referred to? $\Sigma_m = A_m^{\mathbb{Z}}$, which is the space of sequences of elements in $\{1,\ldots,m\}$ indexed by $\mathbb{Z}$, which can be seen as a product $\prod_{z \in \mathbb{Z}} A_m$.
\end{explanation}

\begin{explanation}{stm:ex1.4.3-3}
The product topology is generated by products of open sets. Is there a general result that countable product topologies are generated by cylinders, instead of just by countable products of open sets?
\end{explanation}

\begin{explanation}{stm:ex1.4.3-q4}
Yes, the result is that the $n$-dimensional cylinders form a basis for the product topology. This is exactly the topology on $\Sigma_m$ and $\Sigma_m^+$.
\end{explanation}

\begin{explanation}{stm:ex1.4.3-ga1}
How does (\ref{stm:ex1.4.3-q4}) help us? From a metric we can generate the collection of open balls around all points. A metric generates a topology when, given a basis set $B$ and any point $x \in B$, there is an open ball containing $x$ that is contained in $B$.
\end{explanation}

\begin{statement}{stm:ex1.4.3-a5}
Let $C := C_{j_1,\ldots,j_k}^{n_1,\ldots,n_k} = \{ x = (x_\ell) : x_{n_i} = j_i, i=1,\ldots,k \}$ where $n_1 < n_2 < \cdots < n_k$ are indices in $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{N}$, and $j_i \in A_m$.
\end{statement}

\begin{statement}{stm:ex1.4.3-6}
    Let $x := (x_i)  \in C$.
\end{statement}

\begin{explanation}{stm:ex1.4.3-l6}
We want to show that $C$ contains an open ball $B$ such that $x \in B$.
\end{explanation}

\begin{explanation}{stm:ex1.4.3-a7}
Recall that the metrics on $\Sigma_m$ and $\Sigma_m^+$ are given by $d(x,x') = 2^{-l}$, where $l = \min \{ |i| : x_i \ne x_i' \}$. If we pick $\varepsilon$ small enough, we can construct $B(x, \varepsilon)$ such that all points in $B(x, \varepsilon)$ agree with $x$ up to the ‘largest’ index in the definition of $C$.
\end{explanation}

\begin{statement}{stm:ex1.4.3-8a}
Let $m = \max \{ |n_i| : i \leq k \}$,$y \in B(x, 2^{-m})$, and $l = \min \{ |i| : y_i \ne x_i \}$. 
\end{statement}

\begin{statement}{stm:ex1.4.3-8}
We have $2^{-l} = d(x,y) < 2^{-m}$.
\end{statement}

\begin{statement}{stm:ex1.4.3-9}
From (\ref{stm:ex1.4.3-8}), $l > m$, so $x_{n_i} = y_{n_i} \ \forall i \leq k$, hence $y \in C$.
\end{statement}

\begin{statement}{stm:ex1.4.3-11}
Therefore $B(x, 2^{-m}) \subseteq C$.
\end{statement}

\begin{statement}{stm:ex1.4.3-12}
By (\ref{stm:ex1.4.3-11}), and the fact that the collection of sets such as $C_{j_1,\ldots,j_k}^{n_1,\ldots,n_k}$ form a basis for the product topology, the metrics generate the product topology.
\end{statement}
